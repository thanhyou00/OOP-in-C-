Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

1. OOP is faster and easier to execute
2. OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
3. OOP helps to keep the C++ code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
4. OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time

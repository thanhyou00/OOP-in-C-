## Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming

1. OOP is faster and easier to execute
2. OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
3. OOP helps to keep the C++ code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself",and makes the code easier to maintain,modify and debug
4. OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time
